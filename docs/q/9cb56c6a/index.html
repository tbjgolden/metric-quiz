<p>Explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Approximate how long a marathon is in kilometres.</strong></p>
<p>We know that <strong>5 miles ≈ 8 kilometres</strong><br>
5 x (5 miles) ≈ 5 x (8 kilometres)<br>
25 miles ≈ 40 kilometres<br>
1 + (25 miles) ≈ 1.6 + (40 kilometres)<br>
26 miles ≈ 41.6 kilometres</p>
<p>Real answer: 41.8km</p>

<p>Metric units allow you to convert between seemingly unrelated units.</p>
<p>Here are some useful tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a metre is the same as 100cm, but <strong>a square metre (1m²) is NOT 100cm²</strong>!</p>
<p>It is actually 10,000cm², as 100 * 100 = 10,000.</p>
<p><img src="https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/brioche/uploads/zzwV9Iw3XN-gridzoomsmall.png?width=2400" alt=""></p>
<p>This also means that 1m³ is 1,000,000cm³ as 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000.</p>
<p>People get caught out by this all of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a 1m x 1m x 1m cube of water weighs exactly 1 metric ton (= 1000kg)</p>
<p>It’s advised to always call it a “metric ton” in English, as people frequently get metric tons (a.k.a. tonnes)
and imperial tons confused.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>a 10cm x 10cm x 10cm cube of water weights exactly 1kg and is exactly
the same volume as 1 litre (by design)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.theknittingphysicist.com/assets/images/floppy_cube.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you filled this with water it would weigh almost exactly 1 kg, as
floppy disks are about 10cm wide and tall.</p>
