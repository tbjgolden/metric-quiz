<pre class="language-null"><code is:raw="" class="language-null">kilo = k = 1,000

<p>Looking at these units, it sure would be convenient to have some smaller jumps!</p>
<p>A normal size ruler could be described as 300 millimetres (mm) long, or 0.3 metres (m) long.</p>
<p>But for some reason, humans gravitate towards a unit closer to the scale, and so more decimal
units fill in these gaps.</p>
<pre class="language-null"><code is:raw="" class="language-null">kilo = k = 1,000
------------------------------------------
 ??? = ? =   100
 ??? = ? =    10
               1
               0.1   = d = deci
               0.01  = c = centi
------------------------------------------
               0.001 = m = milli</code></pre>
<p>The question marks are because the prefixes for 10 and 100 are so rare I had to learn them for this!</p>
<p>People clearly prefer to say “10 metres” than “1 <em>decametre</em>”, and “100 metres” than “1 <em>hectometre</em>“.</p>
<p>However, <strong>deci</strong> and <strong>centi</strong> are quite common.</p>
<p>Notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>short lengths that might be measured in inches in imperial are primarily measured in centimetres</li>
<li>some bottles of wine give their volume in centilitres</li>
<li>1 centimetre is equivalent to a 1 percent of a metre</li>
<li>decibels are 1 tenth of a “bel” (who knew?)</li>
</ul>
