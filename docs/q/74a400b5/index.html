    <p>(2)</p><h1 id="10s">10s</h1>
<p>10 in Latin is “decem”.</p>
<p>That’s why December is the… err… 12th month?
It actually was originally the 10th month, but Julius Caesar added “July” and Augustus Caesar added “August” because they were SUPER obsessed with themselves.</p>
<p>Anyway, the modern world uses decimal digits: <code>0123456789</code>.
There are 10 digits (including 0), which is why it is called the decimal system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> there’s nothing special about 10. Society could have chosen a different number and used that instead.
The Babylonians chose 60:</p>
<p><img src="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/blogs/assets/File/Babylonian_numerals.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This number system is why there are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, because 10 is the number we chose for our number system, we can multiply and divide by 10 just by moving the decimal point.</p>
<pre class="language-null"><code is:raw="" class="language-null">0.03 = …00.0300000…
 0.3 = …000.300000…
   3 = …00003.0000…
  30 = …000030.000…
 300 = …0000300.00…</code></pre>
<p>So it made total sense when people were like, why don’t we just use this for every single measurement?</p>
